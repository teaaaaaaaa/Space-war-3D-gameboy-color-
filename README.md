# Space-war-3D-gameboy-color-
A mode 7 style game demo... On an 8-bit handheld.

Built using gbdk 4.0.6, if it doesn't build then try using that version

Featuring:
-a scaling background
-rudimentary but mostly functional hit detection
-sample sound effects, the code for that is from gbdk 4.1.1
-music composed by me

It's on on-rails shooter similar to axelay. Or the lava levels in iridion 3D would make a closer comparison. Just Shoot down the baddies. There's no up and down movement so you're just stuck with moving left and right.
